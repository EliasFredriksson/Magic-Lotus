####################### useOutsideClick #######################

HOW TO USE:
You pass two props:
    - refObject:   Which is a reference (useRef hook).
    - Arrow function which will run when you click outside the container the reference points to.

PURPOSE:
    To easily detect if the user clicks outside of the component.
    To close a dropdown for example.
