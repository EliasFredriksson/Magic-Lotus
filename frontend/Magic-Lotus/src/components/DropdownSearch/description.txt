### DROPDOWN DESCRIPTION ###

HOW TO USE:
A dropdown component with built in animations.
The user CAN search in the inputfield. You provide the list of IData that the user
chooses from. To filter: You modify the list you send via the prop based on the text
from "onSearch" function.

If you want to style the dropdown:
    - add ".dropdown-search" class selector in YOUR scss file. Do not modify the dropdownNoSearch.scss file.



props:
    // REQUIRED
    id:         // "id" property for tag. To attach a label for example.
    name:       // "name" property for when submitting a form.
    placeholder:    // Placeholder of the input ("VÃ¤lj" by default).
    data:       // The list of IData objects that the user selects from.
    onSelect()  // The function that returns chosen value from the component.
    onSearch()  // The function that is being called after the MINIMUM_INPUT_WAIT_TIME
                   duration after the user has stopped typing in the input field. Use
                   this as a searchTerm for example. Gives you what the user has typed in.

    // OPTIONAL
    testId:         // Used for testing with react.
    disabled:       // To turn off the users ability to use the dropdown.
    menuPosition:   // Determines of the opened menu is absolute or relative (absolute by default).
    closeOnSelect:  // Should the menu close when the user chooses an option (true by default).

PURPOSE:
    To have a common shared dropdown component across the project. 
    Aims to be as simple as possible. Can be reused anywhere. Does not
    require any dependencies. This version of the dropdown component is
    meant to work with searching (for example searching for schools).
